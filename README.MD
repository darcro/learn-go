As an experienced Java developer, I felt it worthwhile to explore the world of Golang over time.

In this repo I am attempting to reimplement a project I previously worked on in Java called a BitStream. 

The goal is to have an efficient implementation of a module that can perform bitwise read operations from an underlying `byte[]` buffer.
